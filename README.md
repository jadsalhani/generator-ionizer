## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Yeoman is a miraculous node module that can find an automation for almost every type of project you can think of. 
*First let's install Yeoman.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-ionizer from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-ionizer
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo ionizer appName
```
